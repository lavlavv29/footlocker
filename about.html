                <h2>Our History: How Our Company are Made</h2>
                <p>In 2015, Belle Magdalena had the idea to sell imported shoes from China. 
                    At first she sold women's shoes, but her business did not go well because 
                    there were many competitors who sold similar goods at lower prices.
                    Therefore, Belle had the idea to sell handmade men's shoes made of leather.
                    After a long research, she started her business in 2016.
                    Sales and demand skyrocketed in the second half of 2017.
                    Since she could not fulfil the demand by herself, she gathered other local artists to establish "FootLockRE".
                    Now, the FootLockRE team consists of more than 30 local artists and 50 other staff from all over Indonesia.

                <h2>Our Products: What We Sell and What Will You Get</h2>
                <p>Local art cooperatives bring artists' work to consumers through high-quality handmade goods that are comfortable, durable, and timeless.
                    We sell various kinds of leather shoes, starting from boots, loafers, oxfords, until sneakers.
                    The leather we use is synthetic leather so it is cruelty free, but still of high quality and durability.
                    Each product sold was made by hand and has gone through a long quality control process to guarantee our buyers' satisfaction.
